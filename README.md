# MNIST-Dataset-using-Neural-Net
The MNIST database is a dataset of handwritten digits. It has 60,000 training samples, and 10,000 test samples. Each image is represented by 28x28 pixels, each containing a value 0 - 255 with its grayscale value.

It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.

There are four files available, which contain separately train and test, and images and labels.
